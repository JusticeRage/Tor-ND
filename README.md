# Tor-ND (No Drama)

This project is a fork of the well-known anonymous communication software.
It aims at providing you with all the code from upstream while conveniently filtering out the drama surrounding it.

Original README repdoduced below:

Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository:
        sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
